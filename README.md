Test out for Stage 1 (Harivansh's Mentees)
This is the test out activity for Stage 1. If you have any questions feel free to ask me. I am here to help you. I encourage you to use google or chat gpt to help answer your questions as well if you do not want to ask me. But for the purpose of this test out I want to know you can use git and can look at code and figure out what's wrong. There are many ways to solve the issues. You can use breakpoints to figure out where the issues are (stops the program at a certain point), print statements, or follow the code's logical path, etc. 

1) Open terminal/command line on your computer

2) Make a directory called “test_out1”, and change into that directory

3) You're going to initialize a repo (either online or on command line) within that directory.

4) You will then insert the files I send you into that folder and then you will git add, git commit, and git push all those files to the repository you made. With the git commit add a message saying “test files added”

5) Show me your network graph (screenshot or in person). It should consist of just the first commit with that message.

6) You're going to make a branch from the master/main branch called “fixing_bugs”. 

7) Each time you have tested and resolved the bug issue in one of the program files, you will add commit and push. For the message you will put “fixed blank” where blank is the name of the test file fixed.
   
8)After all files are fixed you will merge your branch back up to main/master (either create a pull request or merge on command line)

9)At the end you will show me your entire network graph. You should have five total dots. Two commits on main and three on the “fixing_bugs” branch.
